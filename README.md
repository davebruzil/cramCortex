## 📖 **My Story: Learning How to Learn**

As a student myself, I discovered something crucial about effective learning: **the way you study matters more than how much you study.**

I was spending countless hours reviewing past exams, but my approach was passive and unstructured. I'd read through questions linearly, without understanding patterns, topics, or my weak areas. This led to inefficient preparation and missed opportunities to focus on what really mattered.

That's when I realized I needed to **learn how to learn** - and that's exactly what cramCortex was born to solve.

### **The Problem I Faced:**
- 📄 Stacks of past exams with no systematic analysis
- 🔄 Repetitive, passive reading without active engagement
- ❓ No understanding of question patterns or topic distribution
- 🎯 Inability to focus practice on specific weak areas
- ⏰ Wasted time on inefficient study methods

### **The Solution I Built:**
cramCortex transforms any test document into an intelligent, interactive study system. Instead of passive reading, you get structured analysis, targeted practice, and data-driven insights into your preparation.

**This tool represents my journey from being an inefficient student to understanding the science of effective learning.**
